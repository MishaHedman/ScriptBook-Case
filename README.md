## Overview and Origin

* ScriptBook is a script analysis & box office forecasting tool.

* It was founded in 2014.

* ScriptBook was founded by Nadira Azermai.

* Nadira Azermai wrote her Masters thesis on using AI to quantify story-parameters into a predictive model.  Writing her thesis prompted her to start ScriptBook.

* ScriptBook has received 1.15 million in funding via seeding investments.

## Business Activities

* Via script analysis, ScriptBook is able to predict the commercial appeal of a project, where it can find it's audience geographically and how much money it will make.  It acts as an added layer of advice when companies are deciding whether to **“Greenlight”** a project.

* ScriptBooks's intended consumers are movie studios, production companies, investors, talent agencies and distributors. 

* ScriptBook currently has 11 competitors in the market that do similar things by analyzing scripts, however it is one of the few that use generative AI and natural language processing.  

* ScriptBook uses generative AI and Natural Language Processing. Nadira Azermai holds two patents for the technology she uses in ScriptBook; Generation of Scripted Narratives and Automated Characterization of Scripted Narratives. It uses machine learning to learn from data and improve it's performance over time.

## Landscape

* ScriptBook is focused on the Film and Television Industry.

* This technology has grown from analyzing scripts to predicting sales outcomes, casting selection, and focused marketing.  Human decision making has been studied for many decades and often used to contemplate box office returns. Box office prediction softwares have been in development for over 20 years using neural networks and now generative AI and natural language processing.

* Other major companies in this field:  Largo *Film and script analysis solutions provider* , Greenlight Essentials *Movie analytics*, Scriptation *PDF Annotation App for Film and TV Production* , Hangzhou Fire Technology *SaaS-based box-office forecasting solutions provider*, Spec Scout *Online script analysis platform*, Pilot Movies *SaaS-based analytics platform for the entertainment industry*, Fliq *AI-based movie analytics* , Scriptsee *Platform offering film and TV pre-production and script analysis*, Epagogix *Box office forecasting tool*, Story Touch *script creation & analysis software*.

## Results

* Some of the measures of success in the field of ai script analysis and box office prediction are the accuracy of the predictions, utilization by the film industry, and market differentiation.  ScriptBook has 87% accuracy when predicting financial performance, it is used by companies in Hollywood and ScriptBook is a leader in the field with two patents on it's generative AI storygenerating tool.

* ScriptBook is currently rated #2 amongst tech companies that provide a similar product. Largo is number 1.

### Recommendations

* I would advise ScriptBook to expand from B2B to include B2C and add production budgeting to their service.

* In addition to offering their service to businesses, I believe offering their service directly to consumers would exponentially expand their customer base.  I would also add a budgeting feature to help advise how much should be spent in each area of production.

* Scriptbook could use technology like [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/templates/film-budget-t-222004375) to aid in film production budgeting. 

* This would provide a well rounded analysis of a films cost, potential income and potential net profit.
